Curio builds next-gen crypto games and infrastructure with strong UGC, starting with our first on-chain 4x strategy game.

By leveraging the composability of crypto, UGC can be enforced and tied into the game meaningfully, which radically shifts the way players interact with the worlds they hold dear.
