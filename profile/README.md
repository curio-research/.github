_"A beginning is a very delicate time ..." - Dune_

We are a group of practical idealists chasing a future for players that's more creative and more free. To do this, we are building Keystone, the foundational infrastructure for our game worlds, and our first flaship social strategy game that's in active development. 

We've assembled a world class game design and engineering team that hail from MiHiYo and more that have launched games to millions. 

We seek for high-agency, self-directed thinkers to join us for the ride.
