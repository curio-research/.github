_"A beginning is a very delicate time ..." - Dune_

We are a group of practical idealists chasing a future for players that's more creative and more free. 
To do this, we are building Keystone, a rollup SDK for our game worlds, and our first flaship social strategy game that's in active development. 

We've assembled a world class game design and engineering team that hail from MiHiYo and more that have launched games to millions. 

We seek for high-agency, self-directed thinkers to join us for the ride.
